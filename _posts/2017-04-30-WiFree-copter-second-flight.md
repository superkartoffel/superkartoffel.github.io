Yesterday I finally had the time to fly the WiFree copter a second time. Controlling it was possible, but quite hard for someone who has never flown a quadcopter before. Since the WiFree copter does not have automatic flight level control, I was already quite busy keeping it at a steady height.

And to make matters worse, the wifi reception drastically decreased after only a few meters, which did not allow me much time to react.

That was an accident waiting to happen! As a precaution I selected a field to fly on. Unfortunately the copter drifted on to a nearby street and crashed.

The 3D-printed frame survived the crashed reasonably well, but three propellers were torn to pieces.
